# Project1-Investigate-a-dataset
This project is done as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. In this project, we will analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy and pandas to make our analysis easier.

Dataset:
I have selected TMDb movie data originally from kaggle for this Data Analysis project. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

Files:
Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code
Investigate_a_Dataset.html:  html file of the project
tmdb_movies.csv: CSV file containing the raw movie data
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project

Installation:
To run the analysis code locally, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib

Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Follow the code and comments in the notebook to understand the analysis process.

Research:
The analysis covers various aspects of movie data, including:
Trends in movie popularity over the years
Distribution of movie genres
Relationship between movie budget and revenue
Relationship between movie popularity and revenue 
Relationship between popularity, budget and revenue.
